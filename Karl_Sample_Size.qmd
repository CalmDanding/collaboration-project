## The sample size you need is 154

# Detail

## This code is for calculating sample size of linear model.(R language)

```{r}
pacman::p_load(pwr)
pwr.f2.test(u = 5, f2 = 0.1/(1 - 0.1), sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9)
```

u: is the number of coefficients you'll have in your model except intercept.

f2: is proportion of variance explained and.

$$f_2 = \frac{R^2}{1-R^2}$$

sig.level: is significance level.

power: is power.

## Calculate the sample size

The sample size n:

$$n=v+u+1$$

Hence the sample size you need is

$$n = 148 + 5 +1 = 154 $$
